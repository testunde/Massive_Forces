/* to do list & ideas

you can choose every unit and change to its FPS view to control it
routing: a*
recycliong of wrecks

put units, buildings and objects NOT in raycast ignore layer, so you can usw the raycast with left-/rightclick
OR: use the OnMouseEnter() methods WHICH CAN BE A MASSSIVE PERFORMANCE LOST!!!

Documentation.cs:
- add key/button/shortcut functions

CameraControl.cs
- manage HERE all keys (e.g. in BuildMain.cs are seperate Inputs.~)

MouseReaciton.cs
> 'selected' list in BuildMain.cs
> serveral object selection with double click or marking area

units:
- UnitExample.cs with a list for each unit type (same with buildings?)
> NO!! ObjectControl.cs as only control script für all objects (so, also buildings and units!)
