put units, buildings and objects NOT in raycast ignore layer, so you can usw the raycast with left-/rightclick

Documentation.cs:
- add key/button/shortcut functions

Building.cs:
- add HP, Name, etc. as public

MouseReaciton.cs
- deselect with ctrl holded down if the object is already selected (priority: shift higher than ctrl?)
- ctrl ONLY deselevt; shift ONLY select
> select list in BuildMain.cs (#>also turn BuildingArray into list)
> serveral object selection with double click or marking area

units:
- UnitExample.cs with a list for each unit type (same with buildings?)
> NO!! ObjectControl.cs as only control script für all objects (so, also buildings and units!)
